### What I learned

This project helped me understand the some of the various viewport values. It showed me how essential it is to use the various viewport  values when creating web content.

I learned that using these viewport values can make websites more responsive to pages without necessarily writing any media queries. It also helps to ensure consistent sizing across devices which maintains visual balance and user experience across their devices

Overall, this project greatly expanded my knowledge of web development best practices and taught me more about how different viewport units work. It empowered me to create better and more responsive websites.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my code for more responsiveness across all devices, so that my website does not look messy. This will help me create better and more user-friendly websites.
